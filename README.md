Hello!

Here you can find several ML (binary and multiclass classification, regression...) and Computer Vision projects that I have done to learn AI applications.

The entire process is documented: 
- Source of dataset
- Data visualization
- Data collection and preparation
- Model training
- Final conclusions on the outcome of the project
